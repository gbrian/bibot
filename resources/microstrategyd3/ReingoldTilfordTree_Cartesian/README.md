**Name:** Reingoldâ€“Tilford Tree - Cartesian Layout

**Usage:** This visualization needs 1 or more attributes.

**Description:** The tree layout implements the Reingold-Tilford algorithm for efficient, tidy arrangement of layered nodes. 

The depth of nodes is computed by distance from the root, leading to a ragged appearance. Radial orientations are also supported. Implementation based on work by Jeff Heer and Jason Davies using Buchheim et al.'s linear-time variant of the Reingold-Tilford algorithm.

The difference to the standard cluster dendrogram is more noticeable with more complex hiearchies.

**Example scenario:** Tidy representation of hiearchy. Organizational structures.
