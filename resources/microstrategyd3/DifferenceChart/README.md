**Usage:** This visualisation needs 2 attributes (e.g category and date) and 1 metric.  The non-date attribute should have two attribute elements to allow for 'a vs b' analysis. The date element must meet specific format (the format is hardcoded in DifferenceChart.js::parseDate(), and can be customized by changing the format mask in that function. Currently the default format is "%m/%d/%Y").

**Description:** A variation of a bivariate area chart using clipping to alternate colors.
